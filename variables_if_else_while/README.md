# Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), without the help of Google:


## General

* What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
* What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
* What the the relational operators and how to use them
* What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
* What are the boolean operators and how to use them
* How to use the if, if ... else statements
* How to use comments
* How to declare variables of types char, int, unsigned int
* How to assign values to variables
* How to print the values of variables of type char, int, unsigned int with printf
* How to use the while loop
* How to use variables with the while loop
* How to print variables using printf
* What is the ASCII character set
* What are the purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64


# Requirements


## General

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project
* There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
* You are not allowed to use system
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/hs-hq/Betty/blob/main/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/hs-hq/Betty/blob/main/betty-doc.pl)
